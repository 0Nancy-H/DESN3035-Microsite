    <h1>Hello! <span style='font-size:100px;'>&#128075;</span></h1>
    <p>I’m Nancy! Before I delve into what this microsite is about, let me introduce myself a bit. I
        enjoy spending time outdoors, going on hikes, and taking walks with my dog, Chloe. My educational
        journey began with illustration, and I’ve recently started exploring front-end web development, which
        led me to create this microsite—a combination of my hobbies and skills.

        <!--Probably insert 3 photos of LA here-->

        <br>One of my favorite pursuits that I want to highlight here is traveling and trying new foods from
        different places. Lately, I’ve been exploring Los Angeles, California. Every time I visit LA, I discover
        new eateries while also returning to my beloved spots. This microsite is a way for me to showcase my
        HTML and CSS skills while sharing my food adventures, offering suggestions for anyone seeking dining
        ideas in LA.
